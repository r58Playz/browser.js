/**
 * The oracle's request bodies and the sandbox's have to land under the SAME
 * filename, or a byte-diff pairs nothing.
 *
 * A hash says two bodies differ. It cannot say how, and "1067 bytes more than
 * the other side" on a Cloudflare payload is not a question a hash can answer
 * -- so both sides also write their bytes out, keyed by url and ordinal. The
 * oracle writes from C++ inside the network service (`BodyFileStem` in
 * `chrome/browser/headless/sbxdiff_net_replay.cc`); the sandbox's come through
 * the store's beacon and are written by `bodyFileStem` here. Two
 * implementations of one derivation, in two languages, that no build checks.
 *
 * Drift between them is silent and it reads as a RESULT: every dump appears
 * one-sided, which looks exactly like "the other side never sent this request".
 * So this compiles the real C++ and runs it against the real TypeScript.
 *
 *   node --experimental-strip-types --no-warnings --test src/sbxdiff/bodystem.test.ts

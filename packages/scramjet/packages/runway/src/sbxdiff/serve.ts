/**
 * Manual replay: starts the servers, prints the URLs, and optionally launches
 * the patched Chromium on one of them.
 *
 *     pnpm serve --store <dir> --url https://rateyourmusic.com/ --open sandbox
 *     pnpm serve --page probe.html
 *
 * The point is to drive a recorded store by hand -- click the Turnstile widget
 * yourself, scroll the real page, open devtools -- rather than through the
 * differ. Nothing is traced and nothing is compared; this is for looking.
 *
 * Two sides, same store:
 *
 *   sandbox  the target through scramjet, its transport reading the store over
 *            `/__sbxdiff/fetch`. This is the proxied page a user would see.
 *   oracle   the target directly, with Chromium itself replaying the store
 *            (`--sbxdiff-net-replay`). This is the page as it was recorded.
 *
 * Neither passes `--sbxdiff-run`, so the browser stays open until you close it.

/**
 * The prefix under which a response's original, unmodified headers ride along

 *
 * The two consumers of a proxied response disagree, and for around twenty
 * headers there is no single value that satisfies both. The browser must not
 * see the origin's real CSP, COOP or X-Frame-Options or the proxy cannot
 * function, and it must see `Location` and `Link` pointing at the proxy so it
 * resolves them correctly - while the page is entitled to read exactly what the
 * origin sent. So `rewriteResponseHeaders` copies every original under this
 * prefix before it strips and rewrites, and the client-side `Headers`,
 * `XMLHttpRequest` and cache views restore from those copies.
 *
 * Always go through {@link carriedHeaderName} and {@link uncarriedHeaderName}
 * rather than concatenating this. Header names come back lowercased from
 * `Headers` iteration and from `getAllResponseHeaders`, but are written with
 * the origin's own casing, so every comparison against the prefix has to be
 * case-insensitive - which is exactly the sort of thing that gets missed when
 * the literal is spelled out at each site.

 * `sec-fetch-user` or `priority` -- all three ride on a navigation and on
 * nothing else -- might well order differently, and that the way to find out
 * was to measure it rather than reason about it.
 *
 * Measured on a real navigation: it does. The three
 * client hints lead, grouped, where a fetch splits them around
 * `accept-language`; `upgrade-insecure-requests` sits between
 * `accept-language` and `content-type`; and `origin` moves up to just after
 * `user-agent` instead of following `accept`.

 *               sec-ch-ua-mobile user-agent accept origin sec-fetch-*

 *   navigation  sec-ch-ua sec-ch-ua-mobile sec-ch-ua-platform accept-language
 *               upgrade-insecure-requests content-type user-agent origin accept
 *               sec-fetch-* referer accept-encoding cookie
 *
 * Unlike the fetch case ONE table covers both methods here: the GET and the
 * form POST of the same page, taken in the same run, put every header they
 * share in the same place, and `content-type` and `origin` simply appear at
 * fixed points in that sequence when the POST adds them. Taken with a fetch in
 * the same run as a control, which reproduced the table above header for
 * header -- so this is the navigation differing and not the old measurement
 * having drifted.
 *
 * `host`, `connection`, `content-length` and `cache-control` are in the
 * capture and not in the table: they are framing the transport adds, and over
 * HTTP/2 -- which is what the target speaks -- the first three are
 * pseudo-headers that do not sit in this list at all.

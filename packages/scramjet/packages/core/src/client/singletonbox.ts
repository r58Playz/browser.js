	 * it would mint a second wrapper for the same listener registered through a

	 * preserve - would silently stop working across frames.
	 *
	 * Weak at both ends that hold page objects. This was a `Map` of arrays
	 * scanned linearly, which retained every target that had ever had a listener
	 * added - and its callbacks - for the lifetime of the box, and cost O(n) per
	 * add on a target with n listeners. Nesting the (type, capture) key in the
	 * middle keeps the callbacks collectable and the lookup O(1); the middle
	 * `Map` holds only event-type strings and dies with its target.
	 *
	 * The middle key is `capture` as "0"/"1" followed by the type, so that the
	 * two halves cannot be confused for one another whatever the page names its
	 * events. It has to be a `Map` rather than an object: a type is a
	 * page-controlled string, and `"__proto__"` is a legal event name.

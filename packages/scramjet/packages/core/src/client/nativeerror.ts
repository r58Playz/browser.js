/**
 * Errors an interceptor throws itself, shaped so a page cannot tell them from
 * the browser's own.
 *
 * Most of the time a member should let the native throw - that is what the IDL
 * validator's rejection path is for, and an authentic error costs nothing. This
 * exists for the cases where it cannot: where delegating would name the proxy's
 * origin, run a page getter a second time, or perform the very side effect the
 * call was being rejected for.
 *
 * Every format below was measured against Chrome rather than inferred:
 *
 *   execute    Failed to execute 'set' on 'Headers': Invalid name
 *   construct  Failed to construct 'AbortSignal': Illegal constructor
 *   set        Failed to set the 'currentTime' property on 'HTMLMediaElement':
 *              The provided double value is non-finite.
 *   read       Failed to read the 'mode' property from 'RequestInit': The
 *              provided value 'bogus' is not a valid enum value of type
 *              RequestMode.
 *   arity      Failed to execute 'registerProtocolHandler' on 'Navigator':
 *              2 arguments required, but only 0 present.
 *   brand      Illegal invocation
 *
 * `read` doubles as the dictionary-member form and nests: Blink writes a bad
 * enum inside a dictionary as the whole of
 * `Failed to construct 'Request': Failed to read the 'mode' property from
 * 'RequestInit': ...`, which is {@link NativeErrors.message} called twice, the
 * inner result passed out as the outer `detail`.
